**MODULE 2 - CLEAN DATA IN SPREADHSEET WITH SORTING AND FILTERING**

For this activity, imagine you are a data analyst working for the superintendent of a large public school district in Portugal. The superintendent wants to know what factors affect student grades in core subjects and what changes can be made to improve student performance. Your team is going to analyze performance data on high school student achievement in two Portuguese public schools, Gabriel Pereira (GP) and Mouzinho da Silveira (MS). The data was collected by the school district by means of academic reports and student surveys. The data includes information such as:

Student grades

Student background information 

Student study time

Student participation in extracurricular activities

However, before analyzing the data, itâ€™s important to make sure the data is clean. Analyzing bad or dirty data could cause the school district to reach the wrong conclusions and implement ineffective changes. Your assignment is to help clean the data. 

By the time you complete this activity, you will be able to sort data in different ways, apply filters to remove incorrect data and fill in missing data, and convert text data to number format. Cleaning data is a critical phase of the data analysis process. Sorting and filtering are useful techniques for data cleaning, and are also key skills that you will draw on throughout your career as a data analyst.
